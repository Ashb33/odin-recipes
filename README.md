# Ashb33's Book of Brews

## About

A simple recipe website built to practice basic HTML. From the Foundations course on The Odin Project.

## What I learned - Part 1

- git workflow (add, commit, push)
- How to plan a simple website structure with an index.html file that links to other pages
- How to use lists and add pictures and links

## What I learned - Part 2

After learning some basic css, the TOP course has you return to this project and add some styles. I spent a bit more time than we are asked to, but I learned a lot from trial and error and Googling:

- The importance of planning the look of the website before even writing the html, so that when it comes time to style everything, your're not rewriting a bunch of code!
- Thoughtful use of classes, and specificity rules
- The box model, how to position things using padding, margins, etc
- How to use gradients
